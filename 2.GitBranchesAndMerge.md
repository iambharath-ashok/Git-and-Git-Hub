#	Git - Branching and Merging


## What is the branch is for?

-	Branch is for parallel development
-	New features
-	Isolated development

##	How branch is implemented

-	A branch is just a pointer to commit
-	EX: Master branch pointing to second commit
-	The way git knows which branch we are on is by using HEAD pointer

## How to Create a Branch

-	Git command to create a new branch
		
		
		git branch <BRANCH_NAME>
		
-	Below command is used to create and checkout the branch in single command
		
		git checkout -b dev
		
		
## How to checkout or use the branch

-	Git command to checkout or use the branch


	git checkout dev
	
	
## 	HEAD

-	HEAD is a pointer that normally points to a branch
-	Since HEAD Pointer normally points to branch its also called as symbolic pointer
-	HEAD Pointer tell us what we have checked out



## Git log with graph

-	alias graph="git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph"
-	graph 
-	shows the details of all the commits and branches
-	shows where HEAD is pointing to which branch

	Example Logs:

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise (auth)
		$ graph
		* fc0bfc2 (HEAD -> auth) f3 changed in auth
		| * b62c952 (sdn)  On branch sdn
		|/
		* 3510d09 (master) f3
		* f6eb91a  Initial commit

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise (auth)
		$ git checkout sdn
		Switched to branch 'sdn'

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise (sdn)
		$ graph
		* fc0bfc2 (auth) f3 changed in auth
		| * b62c952 (HEAD -> sdn)  On branch sdn
		|/
		* 3510d09 (master) f3
		* f6eb91a  Initial commit
	

##	Git Merges

-	Fast-Forward Merge 
-	3 Way Merge

### Fast-Forward Merge

-	Fast-Forward merge is a straight forward merge
-	Master branch will forward to the latest commit the branch to be merged
	-	Even if there can be multiple commits with in the branch


-	Checking difference b/w two different branches

		git diff master..sdn
	
	-	above command gives the difference b/w the branches

-	git merge sdn

	-	above is a Fast forward merge

	##	Deleting branches

	-	Once work is completed on the branch and its got merged with master branch
		-	We can delete that particular branch

	-	git command to delete the branch

		git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>
		
		git branch -d sdn

	## How to check which branches got merged

	-	git command to check which branches got merged

		git branch --merged


-	logs of Fast forward merge
	
	Logs:	
		
		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (master)
		$ alias graph="git log --all --oneline --decorate --graph"


		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (master)
		$ graph
		* 2aa3fca (HEAD -> master, sdn, auth) Master branch initial commit f1 f2 f3


		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (sdn)
		$ graph
		* 1a6cb41 (HEAD -> sdn) sdn f1 changed
		* 2aa3fca (master, auth) Master branch initial commit f1 f2 f3



		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (auth)
		$ git commit -a -m 'auth branch f2 changed'
		warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in f2.
		The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
		[auth 7e40710] auth branch f2 changed
		 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)


		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (auth)
		$ graph
		* 7e40710 (HEAD -> auth) auth branch f2 changed
		| * 1a6cb41 (sdn) sdn f1 changed
		|/
		* 2aa3fca (master) Master branch initial commit f1 f2 f3

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (master)
		$ git merge sdn
		Updating 2aa3fca..1a6cb41
		Fast-forward
		 f1 | 2 ++
		 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (master)

		|/
		* 2aa3fca Master branch initial commit f1 f2 f3



### 3-Way merge

-	Git will use 3 way merge if there is no direct path b/w the branches
-	Git cant just move the HEAD to new branch, since it may loose the previous branch changes
	-	To avoid this git will look at previous master branch and latest two branches
-	We need to merge two commits to a new merge commit
	-	To make merge commit git will look at 
		-	Base Commit that two branches started from
		-	Then the last commit of each branch

-	Command to do 3-way merge

	-	git merge auth

-	If there were no conflicts then git will do 3-way recursive merge
	-	with a message 'Merge made by recursive strategy'
	

-	logs of Fast forward merge
	
	Logs:	
	
		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (master)
		$ git checkout auth
		Switched to branch 'auth'

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (auth)
		$ git merge master
		Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
		 f1 | 2 ++
		 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (auth)
		$ graph
		*   e4ba815 (HEAD -> auth) Merge branch 'master' into auth
		|\
		| * 1a6cb41 (sdn, master) sdn f1 changed
		* | 7e40710 auth branch f2 changed
		|/
		* 2aa3fca Master branch initial commit f1 f2 f3

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise2 (auth)
		$ git branch --merged
		* auth
		  master
		  sdn

## Merge conflicts

-	Conflict will happen when there are changes at same line in two different branches
-	When we try to merge a branches with conflict then git will automatically enter merge conflict mode
-	When we don't need to solve the merge conflict at that point, we can abort the merge with below command

		git merge --abort
		
	-	above command will once comes to normal mode
	
-	Merging the conflicts

	-	enter into merge mode
	-	enter the conflict file in the editing mode and solve the conflicts 
	-	commit the file so that conflict will get solved and branches will get merged

## Detached HEAD State

-	Usually HEAD points directly to branch 
-	But when HEAD points to directly to commit then it's in detached state

	### Two ways to solve detached HEAD State


	-	1.	Checking out existing branch
	
		Logs:
			
			AB40286@CNU243BN8S MINGW64 /c/HCDE_Workspace/gitpractise1 (master)
			$ git checkout bbac748
			Note: checking out 'bbac748'.

			You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
			changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
			state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

			If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
			do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

			  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

			HEAD is now at bbac748 auth commit f2

			AB40286@CNU243BN8S MINGW64 /c/HCDE_Workspace/gitpractise1 ((bbac748...))
			$ graph
			*   b47220a (master, auth) merge conflicts
			|\
			| *   c95b459 merged conflit
			| |\
			| | * 109be37 sdn merge conflict
			| * | d4ac8d4 Commiting f1 to master
			| * | c0244f4 recommitig f1 in master
			| * | 345f0c9 Git master commit
			| |/
			* | 697cc9f added f1 in auth
			* | bbac748 (HEAD) auth commit f2
			|/
			* b8a97d3 Intial Master Commit
			
			AB40286@CNU243BN8S MINGW64 /c/HCDE_Workspace/gitpractise1 ((bbac748...))
			$ git checkout master
			Previous HEAD position was bbac748 auth commit f2
			Switched to branch 'master'

			AB40286@CNU243BN8S MINGW64 /c/HCDE_Workspace/gitpractise1 (master)

	-	2.	Creating new branch and attaching new branch to commit
			
			
			AB40286@CNU243BN8S MINGW64 /c/HCDE_Workspace/gitpractise1 (master)
			$ git checkout 697cc9f
			Note: checking out '697cc9f'.

			You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
			changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
			state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

			If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
			do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

			  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

			HEAD is now at 697cc9f added f1 in auth

			AB40286@CNU243BN8S MINGW64 /c/HCDE_Workspace/gitpractise1 ((697cc9f...))
			$ git branch stage

			AB40286@CNU243BN8S MINGW64 /c/HCDE_Workspace/gitpractise1 ((697cc9f...))
			$ graph
			*   b47220a (master, auth) merge conflicts
			|\
			| *   c95b459 merged conflit
			| |\
			| | * 109be37 sdn merge conflict
			| * | d4ac8d4 Commiting f1 to master
			| * | c0244f4 recommitig f1 in master
			| * | 345f0c9 Git master commit
			| |/
			* | 697cc9f (HEAD, stage) added f1 in auth
			* | bbac748 auth commit f2
			|/
			* b8a97d3 Intial Master Commit


			AB40286@CNU243BN8S MINGW64 /c/HCDE_Workspace/gitpractise1 ((697cc9f...))
			$ git checkout stage
			Switched to branch 'stage'

			AB40286@CNU243BN8S MINGW64 /c/HCDE_Workspace/gitpractise1 (stage)
			$ graph

## Git Stash

-	Git stash is used to save the working area before staging or committing them
-	Git stash helps when switching b/w branches 
-	We can start working from that stash point when we need
-	Git Stash is used to save the local changes before switching the workspaces
-	Git command to stash the local changes

	git stash 
	git stash -p
